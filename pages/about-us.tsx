        <Text ink="dark" variant="large">
          Many women in their early, mid, and late-twenties/thirties are looking for a place due to common factors.
          Women are transitioning into new careers, new cities, new stages of life, getting out of a breakup, getting
          out of a bad roommate situation, moving because their roomies are moving in with their partnersâ€¦
          <br />
          <br />
          But finding a place in the city can be daunting, unsafe, and a whole job in and of itself. It can be hard to
          find what you&apos;re looking for - affordability, nice space, location, roommates, etc. Women have it hard
          enough as it is, without enough credit.
